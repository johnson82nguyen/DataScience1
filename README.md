# Data Science

This is an example project on how to integrate Python and MySQL together. To run this code make sure you have Python and MySQL installed on your local machine. In this version I used Python 3.11 and MySQL 8.0

Once you have Python and MySQL installed run the following command

```bash

pip install mysql-connector
```

This will allow you to write SQL queries to your MySQL database in Python.
